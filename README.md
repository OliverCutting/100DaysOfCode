# 100DaysOfCode

I will be using this repo to track my progress on the 100 days of code Python challenge. At this stage I am an apprentice DevOps Engineer working with DWP Digital so opted to skip the beginning stages of the challenge as suggested. The starting knowledge quiz suggested I start at day 32 as I got full marks on the quiz, however there are a few projects that have caught my eye from the earlier days so I will likely complete them just for fun. It is also unlikely that I will complete this challenge in the 1 project a day form, as part of my apprenticeship includes having a 'personal development' day once a week. So I may do a few challenges on that day to allow me to focus on my work with DWP the rest of the week.
