# Day 27: Miles to Kilometres Converter Project

Day 27 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge had me create a simple GUI converter. I built the app to the spec requested and then tweaked it to remove the convert button, instead opting for instant feedback whenever the miles entry box is edited. I enjoyed this project despite its simplicity as I have never worked with GUI applications in python.
